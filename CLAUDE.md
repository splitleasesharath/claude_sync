# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is currently an empty workspace with no established codebase. The only existing configuration is:

- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Contains Claude-specific permission settings for Bash directory access

## Getting Started

When a project is initialized in this directory, update this file with:

1. Build and development commands specific to the project
2. Testing commands and patterns  
3. Architecture overview once code structure is established
4. Any project-specific conventions or patterns

Until a codebase exists, there are no specific commands or architecture to document.
